# Task: Authentication Audit & Implementation Plan

## Objective
Audit codebase for user/admin authentication, then create phased implementation plan if missing.

## Completed: Codebase Audit
- [x] Check backend auth middleware (only VerifyOrderOwnership.php)
- [x] Check Laravel auth configuration (no auth.php published)
- [x] Check admin routes protection (NONE - unprotected)
- [x] Check order placement flow (NONE - no auth required)
- [x] Check frontend auth state (NONE - no auth store/context)
- [x] Identify existing patterns (Sanctum installed but not configured)

## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED
| Component | Status | Risk |
|-----------|--------|------|
| AuthController | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Login/Register routes | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Orders auth middleware | ❌ Missing | MEDIUM |
| Payments auth middleware | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Admin dashboard protection | ❌ Missing | CRITICAL |
| Frontend auth store | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Frontend auth context | ❌ Missing | HIGH |
| Role-based access (admin) | ❌ Missing | CRITICAL |

## Current: Planning
- [/] Research enterprise auth options
- [ ] Create phased implementation plan
- [ ] Validate against codebase
- [ ] Request user approval
