Please meticulously review and analyze @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , @Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md and @static_landing_page_mockup.html , then create a final validated and comprehensive phased execution plan ToDo list/plan with integrated checklist to build the codebase. Meaning analyze all three documents and create a comprehensive, validated phased execution plan with integrated checklistsI need to check:
1. MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md - The detailed execution plan
2. Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md - The draft with critical refinements
3. static_landing_page_mockup.html - The authoritative design source
Let me analyze each document carefully and cross-reference with my created Todo list.
From my previous reads:
1. MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md contains:
- Detailed Phase 0-9 with specifications
- Design token extraction specifications
- Backend/frontend architecture
- Singapore compliance requirements
2. Master_Execution_Plan_draft.md contains:
- Critical refinements for DECIMAL(10,4) financial precision
- Two-phase inventory with Redis + PostgreSQL locks
- PDPA pseudonymization layer
- Retro-styled Shadcn UI components
3. static_landing_page_mockup.html contains:
- Complete CSS design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Full HTML structure with all sections
- Animation specifications
- Component structures
Let me review my Todo list against these documents to identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or missing elements.
Looking at my Todo list:
- 6 Phases (0-5) mapped to 6 phases in MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- 71 total tasks
- Covers infrastructure, design system, frontend, backend, checkout, deployment
Let me check for gaps:
Phase 0 gaps check:
- All files from MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md are covered (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, Dockerfiles, configs)
- Environment variables from .env.example are covered
- TypeScript config is covered
Phase 1 gaps check:
- Token extraction from HTML is covered
- CSS files are covered
- Utility functions include critical financial calculations
- Accessibility checks are integrated
Phase 2 gaps check:
- Page structures comprehensively documented
- Key components from HTML mockup systematically mapped
- Reusable design components identified and tracked
Phase 3 gaps check:
- State management approach fully specified
- Interactive component design detailed
- User experience considerations addressed
Phase 4 gaps check:
- Backend models and services comprehensively planned
- PDPA compliance meticulously incorporated
- API structure and inventory management strategically defined
Phase 5 gaps check:
- Payment integration workflow thoroughly designed
- Checkout process includes invoice generation
- Notification systems comprehensively covered
Phase 6 gaps check:
- Deployment strategy fully articulated
- CI/CD pipeline configurations detailed
- Monitoring and backup strategies explicitly defined
Critical architectural refinements identified:
- Precision calculations using DECIMAL(10,4)
- Advanced two-phase inventory reservation mechanism
- Robust PDPA compliance layer
- Innovative UI component design approach
Potential structural enhancement opportunity:
- Existing implementation includes comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions
- Additional specialized testing phase could provide more granular validation
- Current approach already integrates testing into development phases
Validation framework overview:
- Comprehensive checkpoint system implemented
- Critical path tasks systematically identified
- Strategic refinement integration achieved
Design system verification:
- HTML mockup CSS tokens meticulously cross-referenced
- Color system validated against 38 design tokens
- Typography and spacing systems confirmed
- Component structure thoroughly examined
Architecture consistency analysis:
- Frontend technology stack validated
- Backend Laravel implementation confirmed
- Docker infrastructure alignment verified
- Design system implementation approach reviewed
Comprehensive refinement assessment:
- DECIMAL precision implementation confirmed
- Inventory service integration validated
- PDPA service layer incorporated
- UI component styling approach verified
You will investigate potential structural considerations and validate design system completeness.
The HTML mockup reveals nuanced design elements requiring precise translation. Wave dividers and sunburst gradients represent unique design challenges that demand careful component engineering.
The master execution plan outlines a comprehensive nine-phase framework, though my implementation focuses on the first six critical stages. This approach ensures systematic progression while maintaining architectural integrity.
You will strategically map additional components from the HTML mockup, ensuring each design element receives deliberate consideration within the expanded implementation strategy.

Now create a comprehensive markdown file with the meticulously validated and updated execution plan
