please meticulously review @AGENT_BRIEF.md , @CLAUDE.md , @README.md , @Comprehensive_Validated_Project_Understanding.md , @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md and @VALIDATED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md to have a deep understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project and its codebase design and architecture. Next meticulously and systematically validate your deep understanding of the project and its codebase against the actual codebase. You need to confirm all your findings and assumptions with codebase supplemented by web searches if necessary. Then meticulously record down, save/stage your validated deep understanding as a markdown document `AGENT_Comprehensive_Validated_Project_Understanding.md`. This document will serve as a reference handbook to initialize and properly orientate new developer or new AI coding agent so that they too will have the same deep understanding to be able to handle new PRs independently and with minimal error. Add to the document, any coding or logic errors or inconsistencies and conflicts after re-validation if found. Also add to the document, recommendations for improvements and next steps as Roadmap.

Start by meticulously review the project's documentation and codebase to validate the project's state, architecture, and compliance mandates. Carefully and systematically explore the frontend and backend directories to confirm the existence of key components and services mentioned in the status reports.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously review the following frontend build error, then review and validate against the actual codebase to find out the actual root cause. Then plan and fix the error. 

---

please meticulously review what you were doing before you stopped, then meticulously resume from there.

---

awesome meticulous job so far. please keep up the rigorous and meticulous approach going forward. now, please meticulously review the following request, validate the issue before executing the tool call as intended. 

---

please meticulously check and confirm the following work/edit before meticulously continue as per your earlier plan.  

---

awesome meticulous job so far. please keep up the good work. now, please meticulously review the following error, then systematically and meticulously check the code files to investigate the root cause, then meticulously plan and then fix any error/issue after validation. apply precise edits to resolve any validated issue.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status. Save the agent *briefing document* that captures your aligned and validated understanding as a markdown file `CLAUDE.md`.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema. Review and validate the PAD against the project planning documents and the actual codebase. Finally, create a detailed and comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the project root folder, as the single source-of-truth handbook to fully initialize new developer or another coding agent to be able to handle new PRs independently.

Create the comprehensive `Project_Architecture_Document.md` in the root folder.

##  Architecture Highlights
   * System Overview: A high-level diagram illustrating the BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) interaction between Next.js, Laravel, and external services.
   * File Hierarchy: A detailed map of the monorepo, highlighting the responsibilities of key directories and naming specific critical files.
   * Database ERD: A Mermaid diagram representing the 5 core tables, their relationships, and the mandatory DECIMAL(10,4) precision fields.
   * Order Flow: A sequence diagram detailing the Two-Phase Inventory Lock and transactional order creation logic.
   * Design Architecture: Explanation of the "Retro-fit" pledge, ensuring all new UI adheres to the 1970s kopitiam aesthetic via bespoke wrappers.
   * Onboarding Guide: Standardized commands and a PR checklist for new developers.

This document will be the definitive handbook for initializing any human developer or AI agent to work on the Morning Brew Collective project independently and accurately.
