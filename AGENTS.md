Before delivering any solution:
- [ ] Solution meets all stated requirements
- [ ] Code follows language-specific best practices
- [ ] Comprehensive testing has been implemented
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Platform-specific requirements are met
- [ ] Potential edge cases have been considered
- [ ] Long-term maintenance implications have been evaluated

## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

## Technical Decision Log (Phase 4.6 - Order Controller API)

### Redis Key Management (Jan 18, 2026)
- **Problem**: Laravel Redis facade auto-prefixes keys causing double-prefixing during MGET operations
- **Solution**: Extract unprefixed keys before MGET in InventoryService using config('database.redis.options.prefix')
- **Impact**: Reliable inventory reservation commit/rollback operations
- **Files Modified**: `backend/app/Services/InventoryService.php`

### Order Ownership Verification Middleware (Jan 18, 2026)
- **Problem**: Order status endpoints required authentication, blocking guest order management
- **Security Risk**: Removing auth would create IDOR vulnerability (CWE-639) - critical security flaw
- **Analysis**: 
  | Approach | Security | UX | Complexity |
  |----------|----------|-----|------------|
  | Remove auth | 🔴 CRITICAL (IDOR) | ✅ Guest access | Low |
  | Require auth | ✅ Secure | ❌ Breaks guest checkout | Low |
  | Hybrid verification | ✅ Zero Trust | ✅ Both users supported | Medium |
- **Solution**: `VerifyOrderOwnership` middleware with multi-factor verification
  - Authenticated: Verify order.user_id matches auth user (403 if mismatch)
  - Guest: Require customer_email + invoice_number matching (422 if missing, 403 if mismatch)
- **Impact**: Zero-trust security model allowing both authenticated and guest order management
- **Files Created**: `backend/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyOrderOwnership.php`
- **Files Modified**: `backend/routes/api.php`, `backend/bootstrap/app.php`

### Database Composite Unique Constraints (Jan 18, 2026)
- **Problem**: PDPA consent table had unique constraint on pseudonymized_id only, preventing multiple consent types per user
- **Root Cause**: Migration created single-column unique index instead of composite
- **Symptom**: SQLSTATE[23505] duplicate key violation when recording multiple consent types (marketing + analytics)
- **Solution**: Migration to drop unique(pseudonymized_id) and add unique(pseudonymized_id, consent_type)
- **Impact**: Users can now grant marketing, analytics, and third-party consents independently
- **Files Created**: `backend/database/migrations/2026_01_18_124016_fix_pdpa_consents_constraints.php`

### Soft Delete Consistency (Jan 18, 2026)
- **Problem**: PdpaConsent model used SoftDeletes trait but deleted_at column didn't exist
- **Symptom**: QueryException "column pdpa_consents.deleted_at does not exist" on any query with soft delete scope
- **Root Cause**: Model trait added but migration for deleted_at column was missing
- **Solution**: Created migration to add deleted_at column
- **Lesson**: Always verify database schema matches model traits after migration changes
- **Files Created**: `backend/database/migrations/2026_01_18_124300_add_deleted_at_to_pdpa_consents.php`

### Transaction Boundary Error Handling (Jan 18, 2026)
- **Problem**: PDPA consent unique constraint violation aborted entire order transaction
- **Analysis**: Database transaction included order creation AND consent recording. Unique violation in consent recording rolled back entire order.
- **Solution**: Moved PDPA consent recording OUTSIDE database transaction boundary
- **Pattern**: Non-critical secondary operations should be outside transaction boundaries to prevent cascading failures
- **Files Modified**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/OrderController.php` (moved consent recording after DB::commit())

## Troubleshooting Methodology (Lessons from Phase 4.6)

### Test Failure Analysis Framework
When tests fail, follow this systematic approach:

1. **Isolate the Failure**
   ```bash
   # Run single test with verbose output
   docker compose exec backend php artisan test --filter='TestClass::test_method_name' -v
   ```

2. **Verify Expected vs Actual State**
   ```bash
   # Check database state
   docker compose exec backend php artisan tinker --execute '
   $model = Model::find($id);
   print("Field value: " . $model->field . " (expected: X)\n");
   '
   
   # Check Redis state
   docker compose exec backend php artisan tinker --execute '
   dump(\Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis::get("key"));
   '
   ```

3. **Trace Request Flow with Logging**
   Add Laravel logging in strategic locations:
   ```php
   \Log::debug('Checkpoint name', [
       'variable' => $value,
       'context' => 'method_name'
   ]);
   ```
   Then tail logs: `docker compose exec backend tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`

4. **Verify Middleware Execution**
   - Check route list: `php artisan route:list --name=resource`
   - Verify middleware registered in bootstrap/app.php
   - Test middleware in isolation with tinker

5. **Database Constraint Validation**
   - Check indexes: `php artisan tinker --execute '\DB::select("SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = ?", ["table_name"]);'`
   - Verify composite unique constraints allow expected data permutations

6. **Race Condition Detection**
   For concurrency issues:
   ```bash
   # Run test multiple times
   for i in {1..10}; do docker compose exec backend php artisan test --filter='test_concurrent_inventory'; done
   ```

### Common Pitfalls & Prevention

**PIT-001: Redis Double-Prefixing**
- **Symptom**: Keys stored as `prefix:prefix:key` instead of `prefix:key`
- **Detection**: Check Redis keys in Laravel: `Redis::keys('pattern')` vs direct redis-cli
- **Prevention**: Always extract Laravel prefix before Redis operations with custom patterns
- **Fix**: Use `str_replace(config('database.redis.options.prefix'), '', $fullKey)`

**PIT-002: Transaction Abortion from Secondary Operations**
- **Symptom**: SQLSTATE[25P02] "current transaction is aborted" when querying after error
- **Cause**: Non-critical operations (logging, consent recording) inside transaction boundaries cause cascading failures
- **Prevention**: Move non-critical operations outside transaction boundaries
- **Pattern**: Transaction should ONLY contain critical data integrity operations

**PIT-003: Missing Soft Delete Columns**
- **Symptom**: QueryException "column table.deleted_at does not exist"
- **Cause**: Model has SoftDeletes trait but migration didn't add column
- **Detection**: Check Schema::getColumnListing('table') before using SoftDeletes trait
- **Prevention**: Always verify migration and model consistency

**PIT-004: Unique Constraint on Wrong Columns**
- **Symptom**: SQLSTATE[23505] when inserting valid multi-row data
- **Cause**: Single-column unique index instead of composite unique index
- **Analysis**: Determine if unique constraint should be per-row or per-combination
- **Fix**: Drop single-column unique, add composite: `$table->unique(['col1', 'col2'])`

**PIT-005: Authorization Missing in Tests**
- **Symptom**: Tests get 401/403 when they expect 200
- **Checklist**:
  - Does route have auth middleware? Check `php artisan route:list`
  - Does test provide ownership verification credentials?
  - For Order status: requires `customer_email` + `invoice_number` OR auth user
  - Are credentials valid? (match actual order data)
  - Is middleware throwing validation errors before controller?

**PIT-006: Inventory Not Restoring on Cancellation**
- **Symptom**: Stock quantity remains reduced after order cancellation
- **Checklist**:
  1. Is endpoint being called? (200 vs 401/422)
  2. Is middleware allowing request through?
  3. Does Order load items relationship? (`$order->items` not null)
  4. Is Product::findOrFail() finding product? (check foreign key)
  5. Is increment() being called? Add logging
  6. Is transaction committing? (`DB::commit()` reached)
  7. Check final state: `Product::fresh()->stock_quantity`

## Testing Philosophy

### Test Failure Categories

**Type 1: Infrastructure Setup Failures**
- Missing migrations: `SQLSTATE[42P01] relation "table" does not exist`
- Permission issues: `EACCES: permission denied`
- Container health: PostgreSQL not ready, Redis connection refused
- **Prevention**: Always verify docker containers healthy before testing

**Type 2: Logic/Implementation Failures**
- Business rule violations: expected vs actual behavior mismatch
- Edge case handling: null values, boundary conditions
- **Remediation**: Add unit tests for the specific failing logic, then fix

**Type 3: Schema/Constraint Failures**
- Foreign key violations: `SQLSTATE[23503] foreign key constraint`
- Unique constraint violations: `SQLSTATE[23505] unique constraint`
- **Remediation**: Check database constraints vs application logic

**Type 4: Transaction/Race Condition Failures**
- Concurrent access: race conditions in Redis operations
- Deadlocks: concurrent database writes
- **Remediation**: Use proper locking, atomic operations, retry logic

**Type 5: Integration/Authentication Failures**
- Middleware blocking: 401, 403 when expecting 200
- Request validation: 422 with validation errors
- **Remediation**: Provide required auth headers or ownership verification data

### Test Quality Metrics

From Phase 4.6 OrderControllerTest remediation:
- **Test Coverage**: 152 assertions over 10 test methods
- **Failure Rate**: Initial 3/10 failures (30%), final 1/10 (10%)
- **Root Causes Fixed**: 4 infrastructure, 3 logic, 2 schema, 1 auth
- **Time to Fix**: ~90 minutes for 9/10 tests passing

Key insight: **Most failures were infrastructure/schema issues, not logic bugs**. This validates the importance of:
1. Proper database migration sequences
2. Composite unique constraints
3. Transaction boundary management
4. Middleware ownership verification

## Interaction Guidelines for AI Agents
When working on this project:
1.  **Read `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`** and the relevant sub-plan (e.g., `.claude/PHASE_2_SUBPLAN.md`) before taking action.
2.  **Verify against `static_landing_page_mockup.html`** for any visual implementation.
3.  **Strictly adhere** to the Singapore compliance rules (especially regarding currency).
4.  **Use the `retro-*` components** instead of generic UI elements.
5.  **Always Validate** your plan with the user before writing code.

## KEY LESSONS FROM PHASE 4.8
Technical Lessons
1. PostgreSQL + Laravel Testing: When using RefreshDatabase with PostgreSQL, indexes can persist across migrations due to connection pooling. Always make migrations fully idempotent.
2. Migration Idempotency Pattern:
public function up(): void
{
    // Check if table exists - prevents duplicate errors with RefreshDatabase
    if (Schema::hasTable('payments')) {
        return;
    }
    
    Schema::create('payments', function (Blueprint $table) {
        // ... table definition
    });
}
3. Service Layer Architecture: Separate provider-specific services (StripeService, PayNowService) from orchestration layer (PaymentService) for clean abstraction and testability.
4. Webhook Security: Signature verification must happen before any processing. Invalid signatures should return HTTP 400 immediately.
Process Lessons
1. Early Testing: Create tests during implementation, not after. Issues are easier to fix when caught early.
2. Migration Verification: Always test migrations in both directions (migrate and rollback) before proceeding.
3. Documentation Parallel: Write documentation alongside code, not as an afterthought. It forces clarity of design.

💡 KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS FROM PHASE 4.8
Decision 1: Provider-Specific Service Pattern
Chosen: Separate StripeService and PayNowService from PaymentService orchestrator
Rationale: Clean abstraction allows mocking in tests, independent provider upgrades, clear separation of concerns
Impact: Easy to add new payment providers (e.g., GrabPay, PayPal) by creating new Service classes
Decision 2: Webhook-Driven Status Updates
Chosen: Order status updates only via webhooks, not API polling
Rationale: Accurate, real-time status reflects actual payment provider state; prevents race conditions
Implementation: WebhookController → PaymentService → order.update('status' => 'processing')
Decision 3: Soft Deletes for Payments
Chosen: Added SoftDeletes trait to Payment model
Rationale: Regulatory compliance requires retaining payment records for 7 years (Singapore regulations)
Implementation: Uses deleted_at column, no actual data deletion
Decision 4: Inventory Restoration on Refund
Chosen: Optional inventory restoration via restore_inventory parameter
Rationale: Some refunds shouldn't restore inventory (e.g., hygiene products, custom orders)
Implementation: PaymentService checks flag, calls InventoryService method
Decision 5: Amount Validation in Service Layer
Chosen: Validate payment amount matches order total in PaymentService, not controller
Rationale: Prevents mismatched payments at business logic level, reusable across controllers
Implementation: if ($order->total_amount !== $amount) throw Exception
