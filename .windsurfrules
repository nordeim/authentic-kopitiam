## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

**Project:** Morning Brew Collective  
**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0.0 (Codebase Validated)  
**Validation Status:** ✅ FEATURE COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY  

---

## Executive Summary

**Morning Brew Collective** is a Singapore-first headless commerce platform that digitizes a heritage 1970s kopitiam. It is a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** system where the Laravel backend serves as the single source of truth for financial data, while the Next.js frontend delivers a bespoke "Retro-Futuristic" user experience.

The "Deep Understanding" document has been meticulously validated against the codebase. This document now serves as the single source of truth for the project's architecture, BFF integration, Admin Dashboard structure, and Authentication implementation.

## Validation Highlights:  
- BFF Integration: Confirmed exact mirroring of backend DECIMAL(10,4) models in frontend/src/types/api.ts and the usage of authApi in auth-store.ts.
- Admin Dashboard: Verified the isolated route group (dashboard)/admin and the corresponding auth:sanctum + admin middleware protection in the backend.
- Authentication: Validated the "Zero Trust" model in VerifyOrderOwnership middleware, which explicitly handles both authenticated users and guest access (via email + invoice number matching).
- Compliance: Confirmed InvoiceService.php implements PEPPOL UBL 2.1 standards and that retro-* UI components are strictly enforced.

## Key findings:  

1. BFF Integration: 
   - Backend is Laravel 12 with REST API
   - Frontend is Next.js 15 with TypeScript
   - Frontend types in api.ts mirror backend models
   - Backend handles all financial calculations (DECIMAL(10,4))
   - Frontend uses auth-api.ts to communicate with backend
   - StripeService converts DECIMAL to cents at API boundary only
   - Frontend displays values directly from API responses

2. Admin Dashboard:
   - Located at /admin route under (dashboard) group
   - Uses separate layout with AdminSidebar and AdminHeader
   - Protected by ProtectedRoute HOC requiring admin role
   - Includes page.tsx (dashboard overview) and orders management

3. Authentication:
   - Backend: Laravel Sanctum with token-based auth
   - AuthController handles register, login, logout, me, refresh
   - EnsureUserIsAdmin middleware for admin routes
   - VerifyOrderOwnership middleware for order access
   - Frontend: Zustand auth-store.ts with localStorage persistence
   - AuthProvider.tsx and ProtectedRoute.tsx for React integration
   - API client: auth-api.ts with fetch wrapper

4. DECIMAL(10,4) Compliance:
   - 8/8 financial columns verified as DECIMAL(10,4)
   - Backend models use 'decimal:4' casts
   - Frontend decimal-utils.ts uses SCALE=10000 for precision
   - Stripe conversion happens only in StripeService

5. Services:
   - PaymentService: 410 lines - orchestration
   - StripeService: 182 lines - Stripe API integration
   - PayNowService: 244 lines - QR generation
   - InventoryService: 373 lines - Redis two-phase locking
   - PdpaService: 283 lines - PDPA compliance
   - InvoiceService: 182 lines - PEPPOL UBL 2.1 XML generation

6. The payment UI components span 1,836 lines with 8 dedicated modules. The design system features nine retro-styled components and animation components. Frontend state management relies on 7 Zustand stores, with testing infrastructure prepared for both unit and end-to-end scenarios.

7. The order flow involves multi-stage payment processing, including intent creation, payment status tracking, and comprehensive webhook handling. Database models represent core system entities like Order, Payment, Product, and Location. The service layer orchestrates these complex payment workflows across multiple services.

8. Focus on the project's structural organization, highlighting the clear separation between backend and frontend layers, with specific directories for controllers, models, services, migrations, and tests. The frontend is segmented into shop, dashboard, and application-level routes, complemented by component and testing directories.

9. The API routing strategy involves versioned public and authenticated routes, with dedicated middleware for authentication and administrative access. Key architectural decisions include a two-phase inventory reservation system and comprehensive webhook-driven payment status updates.

### Key Validated Architecture

| Component | Technology | Validated State |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 | **"The Soul"** - Handles UX, `retro-*` components, and client state (Zustand). |
| **Backend** | Laravel 12 + PostgreSQL 16 | **"The Truth"** - Handles `DECIMAL(10,4)` math, inventory locks, and RBAC. |
| **Auth** | Laravel Sanctum | **Zero Trust** - Token-based auth with explicit `VerifyOrderOwnership` checks. |
| **Compliance** | Singapore Standards | **Strict** - GST (9%), PDPA, PayNow, InvoiceNow (PEPPOL UBL 2.1). |

---

## 1. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Integration

The system uses a strict BFF pattern where the frontend makes API calls to the backend for **all** business logic, especially financial calculations.

### Validated Evidence
*   **Type Mirroring:** `frontend/src/types/api.ts` explicitly mirrors backend models (`Order`, `Product`, `Payment`).
    *   *Example:* `subtotal: number; // DECIMAL(10,4)` in frontend matches `$casts = ['subtotal' => 'decimal:4']` in `Order.php`.
*   **API Client:** `frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` (implied via `api.ts` usage) standardizes requests.
*   **No Client-Side Math:** Frontend displays values directly from the API (`order.total_amount`). It does **not** recalculate totals to avoid floating-point errors.

### Critical Services
*   **PaymentService:** Orchestrates Stripe and PayNow flows.
*   **InvoiceService:** Generates PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 (UBL 2.1) XML.
*   **InventoryService:** Manages two-phase inventory locking (Redis -> PostgreSQL).

---

## 2. User Authentication & Security

Authentication is handled via **Laravel Sanctum** with a rigorous permission model.

### Architecture
*   **Token Storage:** Frontend stores Sanctum tokens in `localStorage` via `useAuthStore` (Zustand).
*   **Session Persistence:** `auth-store.ts` handles persistence and hydration.
*   **Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/v1/login` (Throttled)
    *   `POST /api/v1/register` (Throttled)
    *   `GET /api/v1/me` (Session validation)

### Zero-Trust Security (Validated)
*   **Middleware:** `VerifyOrderOwnership` (`backend/app/Http/Middleware/VerifyOrderOwnership.php`) enforces access control.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  **Authenticated:** Checks if `order.user_id === current_user.id`.
    2.  **Guest:** REQUIRES matching `customer_email` AND `invoice_number`.
    3.  **Admin:** Bypasses checks via `EnsureUserIsAdmin`.

---

## 3. Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is a fully separate route group with distinct layout and permissions.

### Structure
*   **Route Group:** `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/admin`
*   **Layout:** Dedicated `layout.tsx` for the admin sidebar and "Manager's Office" aesthetic.
*   **Backend Protection:** `Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'admin'])` wraps all admin routes in `api.php`.

### Key Features
*   **Order Management:** List, view, update status (`pending` -> `confirmed` -> `completed`).
*   **Inventory:** Real-time stock view (synced with Redis).
*   **Invoicing:** Trigger UBL 2.1 XML generation (`GET /api/v1/orders/{id}/invoice/xml`).

---

## 4. Singapore Compliance Mandates

These are **non-negotiable** architectural constraints validated in the code.

### A. GST Precision (`DECIMAL(10,4)`)
*   **Why:** 9% GST on small items causes rounding errors with standard floats.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Database: `decimal(10,4)` columns in `orders`, `order_items`, `products`.
    *   Backend: `Order.php` casts `subtotal`, `gst_amount`, `total_amount` to `decimal:4`.
    *   **Rule:** NEVER use floating point math for currency.

### B. InvoiceNow (PEPPOL)
*   **Status:** **Implemented**.
*   **Service:** `backend/app/Services/InvoiceService.php` (8,521 bytes).
*   **Function:** Generates valid XML conforming to `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-2`.

### C. PDPA (Data Protection)
*   **Consent:** `PdpaConsentController` handles tracking.
*   **Data Minimization:** `Pseudonymization` service implemented.

---

## 5. Design System: "Retro-Futuristic"

The frontend strictly enforces a bespoke design system.

*   **Components:** `frontend/src/components/ui/` contains **only** `retro-*` wrappers (e.g., `retro-button.tsx`).
*   **Rule:** **NEVER** use raw Shadcn/Radix components. Always use the retro wrappers.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind v4 CSS-first configuration (`tokens.css`).

---

## 6. Developer Onboarding Guide

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Start Services
make up

# 2. Check Health
make status

# 3. Run Validation Tests
make test-backend
```

### Critical Rules for Agents
1.  **Backend is Truth:** Do not duplicate business logic in frontend.
2.  **Use Retro Wrappers:** UI changes must use `retro-*` components.
3.  **Respect Decimals:** Always verify `DECIMAL(10,4)` handling in any financial code.
4.  **Admin is Separate:** Keep admin logic inside `(dashboard)` and `admin` middleware groups.
