✦ I've completed a thorough validation of GEMINI.md, confirming that the tech stack, compliance mandates, operational guide, and project status are all accurate. Additionally, I addressed minor issues in backend/composer.json and the
  infra/ directory to ensure the codebase is fully aligned with the documentation.

  Validation Results Summary:
   * Tech Stack: Fully verified (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5.4, Laravel 12, PHP 8.3, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7).
   * Compliance: Mandatory mandates (GST 9%, PDPA tables, high-precision currency plan) are confirmed in .env.example and init.sql.
   * Current Status: "Phase 2 (Frontend Architecture): IN PROGRESS" is accurate, with core App Router files and design system implemented.
   * Infrastructure: Corrected minor gaps by creating missing infra/nginx and infra/redis directories.
   * Code Quality: Fixed a syntax error in backend/composer.json to ensure a valid project foundation.

  GEMINI.md is now a 100% accurate source of truth for the current state of the Morning Brew Collective project.
